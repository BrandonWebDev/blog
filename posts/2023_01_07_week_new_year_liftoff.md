## ðŸŽ¤ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

This week marks the start of the new year, the start of the LaunchCode LiftOff
program and the start of my blog along with my first blog post! With the
LiftOff program starting, I'll have less time for my personal projects, but it
also means I'll have lots of new things to work on and learn. I'm excited to
start logging my learning journey and sharing my progress in public.

## ðŸªž Reflections

This week, I spent some time reviewing the Spring Security documentation to get
a better understanding of how authentication and authorization work. I found it
helpful to have a basic grasp of these concepts before starting the LiftOff
project as they seemed like one of the toughest aspects of our project that we
knew little about.

One challenge we faced this week was a lack of organization. We started working
on the project without fully fleshing out the user stories or converting them
into tasks which made it difficult to keep track of who was working on what and
what tasks were available. To improve our workflow, I think we should use
GitHub issues to track our tasks and keep them updated with the code, but I'm
not sure if I'll be able to convince the rest.

I also decided to start logging at least once a week to document my progress. I
spent some time researching different tools and frameworks for building my
blog. I'm considering using either Astro.js or Next.js, and I plan to explore
Astro.js first.

In addition to finding the right tools, I also need to figure out a workflow
for writing and publishing my blog posts. I'm thinking about creating templates
or a general structure for my weekly or daily log posts, and using NeoVim or
Emacs to create functions and mappings that will help me generate markdown
files using the specified template.

## ðŸŒ  Goals for next week
- Continue working on the LiftOff project
- Explore Astro.js or Next.js to find the best tool for building my blog
- Develop a workflow for writing and publishing blog posts


I look forward to another fun, productive, and learning-filled week.
